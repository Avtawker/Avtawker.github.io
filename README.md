# Quark Simulation: Mesons & Baryons

Welcome to the Quark Simulation website at [avtawker.github.io](https://avtawker.github.io)! This interactive simulation is designed for anyone curious about the building blocks of matter, offering an engaging way to explore quarks and the particles they form.

## What You Can Do

- **Create and Interact:**  
  Generate quarks and antiquarks with a click, then drag and drop them around the board. Watch as you combine these fundamental particles to form mesons, baryons, and other composite particles.

- **Merge and Discover:**  
  When you drop quarks near each other, a prompt appears asking if you want to merge them. If the combination matches a known particle, its name and composition are displayed. The system intelligently recognizes the same particle regardless of the order in which the quarks are merged.
- **Informative Pop-Ups:**  
  Access additional information about the sparkles and known particles via modals that overlay the simulation with a professional, translucent background for easy readability.

## Technologies & Methods

This project makes use of industry-standard web technologies and design principles to deliver a smooth, interactive experience:
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For a responsive, modern layout and engaging animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** To handle user interactions, particle merging logic, and dynamic visual effects.
- **Best Practices:** Incorporates drag-and-drop interfaces, canonical data sorting, and dynamic content generation to ensure consistent performance and a user-friendly experience.
